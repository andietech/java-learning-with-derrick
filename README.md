Introduction to Java: Class Methods
---
Since we are already adding new classes, this is an important concept to have a look at before proceeding further.

#### OOP Analogy
Lets think about a car (Toyota Corolla) and think about an object (Toyota Corolla KAZ 114X).

The difference here if mapped to Java is that `Toyota Corolla` is a class which describes all attributes and methods (doing word :-)) that are available to fully explain that entity.

On the other hand `Toyota Corolla KAZ 114X` is an object. In Java lingo, easiest way to think of this; it's an instance of a class.

It still remains possible to have another object `Toyota Corolla KBU 115R`


Just for memory sake;

| Class       |  Object     |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Animal      | Dog         |
| Animal      | Cat         |
| Car         | Sedan       |
| Sedan       | Toyota      |

- Complete the methods for `waterDispenserAttribute`
- Resolve error with the `exchangeMoney()` method on the `ExchangeCounter`
- Describe teller attribute. Points: use it in the right class
